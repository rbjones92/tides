# Summary
The best time to ride a fat-tire ebike on the beach is low tide. If I want to ride my ebike to work, it means I have to leave my house around 7am. I will write a program
to find and filter the best days to ride my bike to work. 

# Methods
I will use tide data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to find the best times to ride my ebike to work on the beach.
